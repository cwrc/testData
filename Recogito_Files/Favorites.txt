The Berlin Wall was a concrete barrier that divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989. Constructed by the German Democratic Republic (East Berlin) in 1961, the Wall cut off West Berlin from all of surrounding East Germany and East Berlin until government officials re-opened it in 1989.

After the fall of the Wall, French President Francois Mitterrand warned Thatcher that a unified Germany could make more ground than Adolf Hitler ever had and that Europe would have to bear the consequences.
