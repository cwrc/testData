They varied from mild to almost unbearably severe, and included anxiety attacks, hallucinations, fevers, headaches, and an extreme reluctance (or refusal) to eat. Critics have suggested many different causes, both genetic (mainly from the Stephen side) and situational (with pressures caused by family relations, sexual abuse, her writing, war, and other concerns).

                                    <TITLE TITLETYPE="ANALYTIC">Three Jews</TITLE>) had to be set up and printed two pages at a time; after that they had to break up the type in order to set the next two pages, because their stock of type was so small. Nonetheless, after working almost every afternoon for two months, they published
                                    <TITLE TITLETYPE="MONOGRAPHIC">Two Stories</TITLE> in July that year. In October they embarked on a series of assistants, of whom the first on a commercial footing was

                                    <TITLE TITLETYPE="MONOGRAPHIC">Kew Gardens</TITLE>, Leonard bought the Press a brass nameplate costing half a guinea. In November 1921 they took delivery of a second-hand Minerva printing press worked by a heavy treadle which cost ¥70.10s, and 77 pounds weight of type at a price of ¥18.9s.5d.

So I get a curious shock when I see people regarding her entirely as a martyred . . . or definitely tragic sort of person, claimed by the darkness.
