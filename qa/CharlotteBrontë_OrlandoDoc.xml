                                <P>The BrontÃ« children devised private
                                    <SOCALLED>plays</SOCALLED> in their early years, starting from a group of a dozen wooden soldiers they dubbed the
                                    <SOCALLED>Young Men</SOCALLED>. The games, which initially involved Charlotte, Branwell, Emily, and Anne, developed over many years into the Glass Town Confederation, loosely modelled on the United Kingdom, with a kingdom for each of the four children. Often based on accounts of historical and political events from newspapers and books, the games gave rise to a body of written juvenilia, more and more elaborate sagas of love, hate, betrayal, war, exploration, and politics. The earlier stages were documented mostly by Charlotte and Branwell, and eventually gave rise to the very different Oriental and imperial Angria. The vividness of this imaginative play is evident in the degree to which the worlds of their creation merge with the real world in Emily's diary. Elements of fantasy played a significant role in the lives of the BrontÃ« children into their mid-twenties.

After he gave up his Bradford studio, he worked as a private tutor in the Lake District, where he pursued literary encouragement from local writers. He soon lost his post, possibly as a result of fathering an illegitimate child. Back in Yorkshire, he worked as a clerk for the Leeds and Manchester Railway, but was again dismissed.
